Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
Make sure you have the necessary extensions installed, such as the Spring Boot Extension Pack.
Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS.
Type "Spring Boot Dashboard: Start" and select the option to start the Spring Boot Dashboard.
In the Spring Boot Dashboard, select the project you want to run and click the "Run" button.
You can also run the project from the command line by opening a terminal in Visual Studio Code and running the command ./mvnw spring-boot:run or ./gradlew bootRun depending on your build tool.
Once the project is running, you can access the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or by visiting the URL in a web browser.
